## Who's Bayu? :mag_right:
Meet Bayu, who magically emerged from the middle of nowhere on Sumatra Island 29 years ago and, through the sheer power of education, navigated his way to Java Island. Armed with a degree in Japanese Language (he even aced the intermediate test, believe it or not), he's a delightful blend of contradictions – funny but serious, lazy but diligent, as predictable as the weather forecast, yet mysteriously captivating. And amidst this wild and wacky world, he firmly believes that everyone deserves a whole lot of love. So, brace yourself for some laughter and maybe a sprinkle of Japanese wisdom – Bayu's here to keep the crazy times a little less crazy!

## What Does He Do? :pencil2:
Your friendly neighborhood Recruitment Consultant. My job is basically like matchmaking, but for careers. I spend my days helping people find their dream jobs while convincing hiring managers that they've just met their professional soulmates. It's like being a job cupid, but with fewer wings and more LinkedIn connections. Sometimes, I feel like a career detective, deciphering resumes like they're top-secret files.

## What Does He Like? :musical_score:
Bayu's musical journey took an unexpected turn when he stumbled upon [Fujii Kaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujii_Kaze), a Japanese artist whose name and soulful melodies both whispered "Wind." From a chance Spotify encounter to tearful moments at Fujii's August concert, Bayu found his heartstrings resonating most with ["Kaerou"](https://open.spotify.com/track/26e8ujjSpBAHhIY2ymLUT1?si=56f69b3e55e24f49), a song that beautifully weaves together the themes of life, ~~death~~, and the enduring power of love to guide us to peace in the other world.

## What Is His Dream? :airplane:
Bayu's dream? To live a quiet, peaceful life in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand, where the only neighbor is a friendly sheep who's always up for a good chat!
